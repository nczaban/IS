\chapter{Future Work}
We have seen with a limited survey sample that video game AI models are more challenging for players when they have larger sets of possible actions within the game. However, it would be useful to create a full extensive-tree model of the updated game, like the extensive tree created for the simpler version of the game. With such a tree, deeper analysis can be done on the effectiveness of each AI model. When the outcomes of the game are known, a more complex AI model can be created to specifically seek their winning outcomes. Additionally, this tree could help balance the game. If one player can reliably win using the same strategy each game, then certain parts of the game can be tweaked to mitigate such outcomes; for instance, the amount of damage dealt by a particular action could be decreased, or the probability of missing a strong attack could be increased. Given the random chance of missing strong attacks, there likely is not a simple solution to be found by backwards induction, but given the percentage of missed attacks a mixed strategy could be used to determine the optimal action.\\

Alternative machine learning models can be used to implement the AI. With the complete version of the game, an artificial neural network can be made to simulate the game and learn to play optimally. In some ways, this would be more efficient than attempting to solve the entire game in an extensive-form tree, but the neural network would not show why its decisions were optimal.
