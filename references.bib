	Pages = {216-250},
	Year = 2008,
	Annotate = {The authors of this paper set out to create substantial rules for what a well-defined extensive form game is. They focus on two traits in particular: Every strategy produces an outcome in the game, and the outcome of a particular strategy is unique. The authors then go on to describe the properties of game trees which have these traits, as well as how the trees can be applied to different types of games. Alos-Ferrer and Ritzberger go on to explore which situations and trees have strategies which produce outcomes, and situations where outcomes are not unique. Although the article's language is very esoteric, this source provides some excellent definitions which will be indispensable to the theory section.}}

	Title = {Stochastic games},
	Journal = {Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America},
	Volume = 112,
	Issue = 45,
	Pages = {13743-13746},
    Year = 2015,
	Annotate = {This article focuses on the history and importance of Lloyd Shapley's paper on stochastic games. Stochastic games are those where a particular choice may have multiple, sometimes contradictory, effects. This type of decision making and decision balancing means that players must consider future payoffs when making choices in the game. One major area of stochastic games are repeated games or those with imperfect information. Players must make their decisions based on their privately-held information, and their lack of knowledge may lead to them making a bad decision. This article was particularly lacking an in-depth discussion of the mathematics, but there are a number of sources cited in this paper which may contain a more robust definition. Stochastic games will likely be relevant when fuzzy logic is implemented into the game, since it may not be clear in which fuzzy set a player is included, thus limiting the information of the game.}}

@book{mail06,
    Author = {George J. ~Mailath and Larry ~Samuelson},
	Title = {Repeated Games and Reputations},
	Publisher = {Oxford University},
	Year = 2006,
	Annotate = {In their book, Mailath and Samuelson describe games with "intertemporal incentives," or the idea of value persisting between one iteration of a game and the next. For example, a player who bluffs in a card game will be less successful in future games if other players learn they are bluffing. The text looks at three different types of repeated games, separated by types of monitoring: perfect, imperfect public, and private monitoring. The authors also look at the formation of a player's reputation, both in the long-term and short-term. While designing my game, these concepts could be incorporated as a type of difficulty curving. Players who are doing well will have notoriety with their enemies and attract stronger challengers, while players who are doing poorly will attract overconfident opponents.}}

    Address = {Pittsburg, PA},
	Author = {Jesse ~Schell},
	Publisher = {CRC Press},
	Title = {The Art of Game Design},
	Year = 2015,
	Annotate = {Jesse Schell provides a in-depth look at the process of game design, building up from a general experience the designer wishes to create toward a rich, intricate world that satisfies all requirements given to the designer. The text is very accessible, with very little math or programming knowledge required. Instead, its purpose is to focus on the creative process of game design, a purpose which will be useful to keep in mind when designing the final software. Aside from the theory and algorithms, the game should still be enjoyable.}}

@book{schw04,
    Address = {Hingham, MA},
	Author = {Brian ~Schwab},
	Publisher = {Charles River Media},
	Title = {AI Game Engine Programming},
	Year = 2004,
	Annotate = {Brian Schwab outlines a basic model of AI for a number of video game genres in his book. Schwab spends a good deal of time tying the individual elements that make up a typical game of the genre to the type and amound of AI these elements need or can use. The book also touches on fuzzy-state machines, which is a superset of logic capable of handling partial truths. The fuzzy set chapter will be very useful in expanding the AI of the game to understand healthy or unhealthy states. There is also code snippets both from actual RPGs and for a fuzzy-state machine class, both of which will be invaluable resources for the software component of my IS.}}

    Address = {Sebastapol, CA},
	Author = {Toby ~Segaran},
	Publisher = {O'Reilly},
	Title = {Programming Collective Intelligence},
	Year = 2007,
	Annotate = {In this book, Segaran introduces a number of instances where collective intelligence, or the combination and analysis of information from various sources, and introduces an algorithm that can be used to improve this scenario. For example, a website may use decision trees to predict which users will become paying customers after signing up for a free trial. The author goes on to describe how to implement these algorithms in Python. Many of these algorithms are not useful in creating a video game, but the sections on decision trees and possibly the section on genetic algorithms will be helpful in developing the AI of the game enemies.}}

@book{shoh09,
    Address = {New York},
	Author = {Yoav ~Shoham and Kevin ~Leyton-Brown},
	Publisher = {Cambridge University},
	Title = {Multiagent Systems},
    Year = 2009,
	Annotate = {This book is designed as an introduction to the field of multiagent systems, a group of multiple autonomous entities with different interests or information. These systems are built heavily upon game theory. Shoham and Leyton-Brown provide several formal definitions of game theory topics, while still providing excellent examples and easy-to-understand descriptions. The section on extensive-form game trees, in particular, is extremely useful. Their explanations of how to model sequential games and use the models to calculate equilibria are superb.}}

@book{smed06,
    Author = {Jouni ~Smed and Harri ~Hakonen},
	Publisher = {John Wiley \& Sons},
	Address = {West Sussex, England},
	Title = {Algorithms and Networking for Computer Games},
	Year = 2006,
	Annotate = {In their book, Smed and Hakonen look at various computer algorithms that are essential to creating a computer game. The book also goes into detail about the computer networking knowledge needed to implement online multiplayer in a computer game. While the book does contain some excellent pseudocode for each algorithm, the mathematics behind each algorithm is largely ignored. However, this text does a fantastic job of explaining each concept in plain English, and provides some clear examples of games utilizing each concept. Among the algorithms described by the authors, the most useful to my project will be the game trees, decision making, and fuzzy sets/constraint problems.}}

	Edition = {2nd},
	Year = 2010,
	Annotate = {This book provides a comprehensive look at game development from design and programming to the business side. Each section is written by an expert in their field, combining over 20 professional game developers in one volume. The design chapter looks at the psychological aspects that a designer can use to ellicit their desired emotions from players, as well as ways that make the game intuitive. The programming section details various programming paradigms, the difference between game-specific and game-engine code, and algorithms for collision detection, physics simulations, and the graphics pipeline. A section on artificial intelligence mentions various different techniques, but offers little substantive on how to implement them; there are, however, extensive citations that may be of more use.}}

	Title = {Fuzzy Sets},
	Journal = {Information and Control},
	Volume = 8,
	Pages = {338-353},
	Year = 1965,
	Annotate = {This article is the original publication discussing fuzzy sets, or sets without rigid definition membership. As the first in its field, it contains thorough mathematical definitions of fuzzy sets. Zadeh goes on to define how various functions and properties, such as union, algebraic product, and convexity, operate on fuzzy sets. Each theorem is accompanied by a proof; these proofs are clear and concise. Since the entire field of fuzzy sets is built upon this paper, this source will be crucial for understanding fuzzy logic and fuzzy-state machines.}}
